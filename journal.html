                He smiled at me again today. That big, bright, beautiful smile that used to make my heart feel at home. For the longest time, he <i>was</i> home. I've  always told him that he had a beautiful smile but I don't think he ever believed me. I used to be scared to look into his eyes and see him smile like that. As time went on and I got more comfortable, part of me wishes we both weren't so nervous.<br><br>
                He smiled at me again today. And this time, for the first time in weeks, I smiled back. Today seemed different. I didn't avert my eyes. I just habitually smiled. But this time it was different. I still smiled because he was happy, and it was evident that he was. I still smiled because we left off on good terms. I still smiled out of genuine habit of smiling when he's around. But I didn't smile because he gave me butterflies anymore. I didn't smile because he was mine anymore. I didn't smile because he wasn't home anymore.<br><br>
                And I felt okay with that.<br><br>
                I don't think I'll ever forget him. I forgive him and I hope the absolute best for him. I hope he keeps smiling and finally shows the world that big, bright, beautiful smile. And I hope that I keep smiling too.

                tbh its a minimum day but i already wanna go home. i have a meeting and tutoring today adjfhajdhfaskldj nice!
                i think i need to get my life in order... also this might be the last time i tutor kayla :( today has been pretty bad even though nothing really happened. i guess things were just going a little too well. lol.<br><br>we made eye contact today but i couldn't get myself to smile. sucks.<br><br>i used to journal everyday in a mood tracker app. 
                hopefully this will get me back into the habit so i can just let things out and record all the good days. i wanna look back at these and see my life through the minute details that we often forget about. i'll try to make 1-2 posts everyday like a spam account
